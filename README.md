# TRProject
Uses jsonplaceholder API todos response to demonstrate mapping and sorting

Using the following API: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos 

Write a small native mobile app that will display: 

1. An initial screen that consists of a table with one row for each unique "userId" 
2. In each row there should be a count for the number of incomplete todos (determined by "completed": false) 
3. The rows should be sorted descending by the number of incomplete todos 
4. Clicking on a user will bring up a detail page that contains all the todos associated with that user
